  <h3>Bio</h3>
  <p>
    I am a Graduate from The University of New Orleans and Southern New Hampshire
    University with a major in General Studies and Game Programming and Development.
    Throughout my career, I have dedicated my life to working with young people in
    schools across the New Orleans Metro region. For the past 4 years I have worked
    as a technology teacher and educational technologist at Audubon Charter School.
    During my time at Audubon, I have created and implemented a Web Design Curriculum
    for students in grades 6th-8th. I also helped to coordinate standardized testing
    on computers and other technological devices. It has been my lifelong passion
    to integrate technology in education to help students reach their full potential.
